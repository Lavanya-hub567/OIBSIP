                <p class="para1"> <strong><em>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro</em></strong> was born in the São Pedro parish of Funchal,
                    the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António 
                    is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club

            <center><h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3></center>
            <p>As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995, where his father was the kit man,
                and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP,
                and was selected. He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon,
                to join Sporting's youth academy.By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play
                semi-professionally and agreed with his mother to cease his education to focus entirely on football.</p>
                <br>
            <p> He was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.
                Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one,
                 altering his resting heart rate.
                 He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.[21]</p>

        <h3>SPORTING</h3>
        <img class="image" src="childhood.jpg" alt="Ronaldo pic">
        <p>At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, 
            who was impressed with his dribbling.He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16,
            under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.
            <br>
            Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently,
             after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade in August 2003.
        </p>
        
        <h4>MANCHESTER UNITED</h4>
          <img  src="mcity.jpg" alt="Ronaldo pic">
        <p>
            Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield 
            but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season, and made him the 
            first Portuguese player to sign for the club. His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager 
            in English football history. Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number
             7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.
             Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.A key element in his development during
              his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said:
             "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career."

        <h4>REAL MADRID</h4>
        <img  src="RM.jpg" alt="Ronaldo pic" style=" width:400px;"><br>
        <p>
            Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time, of £80 million (€94 million).
            His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause.
            At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu,
            surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.
            Ronaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coruña on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3–2 home win.
            He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so.
            His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich.

            <h4><strong><b>JUVENTUS</strong></b></h4>
            <img  src="juv.jpg" alt="Ronaldo pic" style=" width:400px;"><br>
            On 18 August, Ronaldo made his debut in a 3–2 away win against ChievoVerona.
            On 16 September, Ronaldo scored his first two goals for Juventus in his fourth appearance in a 2–1 home win 
            over Sassuolo in Serie A; his second was the 400th league goal of his career. On 19 September,
            in his first Champions League match for Juventus, he was sent off in the 29th minute for "violent conduct",
            his first red card in 154 tournament appearances.Ronaldo became the first player in history to 
            win 100 Champions League matches, setting up Mario Mandžukić's winner in a 1–0 home win over Valencia,
            which sealed Juventus's passage to the knock-out stages of the competition. In December, 
            he scored his tenth league goal of the season, from the penalty spot, netting the final goal
            in a 3–0 away win over Fiorentina.After placing second in both the 2018 
            UEFA Men's Player of the Year and 2018 The Best FIFA Men's Player for the first time in three years

            <h4>RETURN TO MANCHESTER UNITED</h4>

            Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to re-sign Ronaldo,
            subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and medical.The transfer was reported as costing
            an initial £12.85 million, with a two-year contract plus an optional year, and was confirmed on 31 August.
            Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt after Edinson Cavani agreed to switch to 21
            The first 24 hours of Ronaldo's shirt sales was reported to have broken the all-time 
            record following a transfer, overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.

        <center><h2>INTERNATIONAL CAREER</h2></center>
        <img class="image" src="inter.jpg" alt="Ronaldo pic">
        <p>
            Ronaldo began his international career with Portugal under-15 in 2001. During his international youth career,
            Ronaldo would represent the under-15, under-17, under-20,
            under-21 and under-23 national sides, amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall.
            Ronaldo scored twice in Portugal's first game of Euro 2020, a 3–0 win against Hungary in Budapest
            This took him to a total of eleven European Championship goals, two clear of Michel Platini, 
            as the all-time top goalscorer in the competition's history.[387] He also became the first player
            to score at five European Championships,
            and in eleven consecutive tournaments.
            <br>
            Ronaldo scored two headed goals, with his second coming seconds before the full-time whistle, 
            in a 2–1 home win against the Republic of Ireland in a World Cup qualifier at the Estádio Algarve, 
            which saw him pass Ali Daei's international record of 109 goals to become the sole record holder.
            On 9 October, he scored the opening goal in a 3–0 friendly win over Qatar at the Estádio Algarve;
            with his 181st international appearance, he also overtook Sergio Ramos's record for the most international
            caps received by a European player.In the following match against Luxembourg on 12 October,
            also played at the Estádio Algarve, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 win for Portugal,
            and became the first player to score 10 hat-tricks in men's international football.
